# pushy-demo-java

A demo of the Pushy Java SDK integrated into a sample Java desktop app.

> [Pushy](https://pushy.me/) is the most reliable push notification gateway, perfect for real-time, mission-critical applications.

This app registers your computer to receive push notifications and assigns it a unique token, which you can copy and paste into the [demo page](https://pushy.me/docs/resources/demo) to send yourself a test push notification.

Visit our documentation to [integrate Pushy into your existing Java desktop app](https://pushy.me/docs/additional-platforms/java).
